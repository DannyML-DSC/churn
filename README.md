#CHURN PREDICTIONS#
Churn happens when customers are leaving their current service provider and moving to another one. This is a big business problem because it is more expensive to acquire a new customer than to keep an existing one from leaving
i made a simple prediction model using logistic regression(dealing with categorical data), to predict if users will churn(leave) or not given the dataset attached.
